Football Joke Generator
This is a simple Javascript application that generates random football jokes. The application uses the nextBtn() function to display a new joke each time the button is clicked. The jokes are stored in an array called jokes_arr and a random number is generated to select a joke from the array to display on the page. The selected joke is then displayed in the element with the id of addTxt.
